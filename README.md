# movie_api

This is a movie database built mainly using the MERN tech. This repository contains code for the backend; Mongoose and MongoDB were used to create and connect the individual movie objects to a database. Render was then used to host the backend API, and Netlify was used to host the full project with the back and front ends.

This app's development was a fullstack developer as I developed both the front and backend of the app with no team. To view more of the project, including its frontend, visit the frontend repository.
